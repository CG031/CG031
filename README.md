## About Me
My name is **Cristian Gallert**. I hold a degree in Mathematics and have been teaching since 2012.

## Education and Interests
In the second semester of 2024, I started a course in game programming. 

Currently, I am still studying theoretical subjects in my degree while deepening my programming knowledge through external courses, 
focusing on style languages, HTML, and JavaScript, using [Alura](https://www.alura.com.br) courses as a foundation for my programming journey.

I am excited to discover which programming language I will specialize in to create amazing games!
